#### Project Overview
One of the tasks radiologists routinely do every time they do MRI scan is to align an image plan in a 3D volume of a body. In order to make diagnosis doctor should have so-called canonical views. For each body part there is a set of canonical views which usually defined by the set of landmark anotomical points. This task could be very time consuming especially for things like cardiac MRI and it can only be performed by the doctor. 

The goal of this project was to automate view alignment and therefore to increase MRI throughput and ultimately make procedure less expensive and more efficient.  

The approach is depicted on the diagram above and consists of the following steps:
1. Quick acquisition of low quality 3D volume of a target body part (i.e. heart, brain, spine).
2. Use anatomical atlas to constrain search space in the volume.
3. Run convolutional neural network on the constrained volume to find anatomical landmark candidates.
4. Use statistical model to select landmarks from a set of candidates.
5. Generate planes from detected landmarks.

#### History
This project was done in Samsung Research Russia during 2012-2014. It have started from my proposal to a Medical Devices division. The initial idea was refined and supported by Praveen Gulaka who at that time was responsible for the MRI applications. Dmitry Korobchenko was the first to join my team, followed by Alexey Danilevich and later Kirill Gavrilyuk. 

This project was possible due to our great collaboration with National Medical Research Center of Cardiology Russian Federation (Merab Shariya, Dmitry Ustuzhanin and Sergey Ternovoy) who helped us to collect and annotate training and evaluation data.

#### Project facts
* Project was using proprietary branch of my [CUDACNN library](/projects/cudacnn)
* Because 3D convolutions are very expensive we came up with the idea of using three orthogonal projections instead. This allowed us to reduce the inference time but required to do extensive augmentations
* Because the data was scarse (as always with medical data) we tried to use [Predictive sparse decomposition](https://cs.nyu.edu/~yann/research/sparse/index.html) for unsupervised pretraining. We didn't get a lot of improvement though
* This technology ended up running in a real MRI (I even tested it on myself)
* This was one of the first applications of the deep learning for medical imaging
