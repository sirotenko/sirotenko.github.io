This is one of my oldest projects. I've worked on it, when I was a third year student. In this project I've written a software on Visual C++, realizing simple sounds recognition (claps and clicks) with use of fuzzy logic. Software allowed to define a membership function for certain sound which was used for detection. It hasn't very nice apearence, but it works.
