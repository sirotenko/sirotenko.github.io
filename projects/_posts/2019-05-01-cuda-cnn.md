The aim of this project is development of GPU-based library for implementation, training and simulation of convolutional neural networks. Core library implemented in C++/CUDA with Matlab front-end through mex-files.

Current features are:
- Training methods: Stochastic gradient, Stochastic Levenberg-Marquardt
- Layers: Convolutional, Pooling (max, average), Fully-connected
- Transfer functions: Linear, Tansig, Tansig_mod (variance normalized version of tansig)
- CUDA is optional, you can compile CPU version of library, however it's not optimized at all

All dependencies are optional, you can compile library with or without them:
- HDF5 for saving and loading network in this format
- Matlab libs if you want Matlab interface
- Boost needed for shared_ptr in case you don't want to compile lib with C++0x support
- gtest for building tests

Library is distributed under BSD license.
