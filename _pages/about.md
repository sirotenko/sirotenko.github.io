Hi, you're on a personal web-site of Mikhail Sirotenko, research manager, AI enthusiast, startuper and investor. Currently I work as a Technical Lead Manager at Google Research in the New York office where we're working on vision AI that powers many product features at Google including Lens, Image Search, Shopping and few others. I also advice AI startup companies, (rarely) invest in some, and give talks.

#### My background
I have started my first deep learning project after I graduated from high school back in 2000. I have built a C++ neural network library. Later in 2004 I was a captain of our university robotics team and got interested in convolutional neural networks as a way to build a better visual navigation for our autonomous rover and airship. That was 8 years before convolutional neural networks made a big splash on the NeurIPS conference and kicked off the era of deep learning as we know it now. In 2009 I defended my PhD thesis on this subject and co-founded a computer vision company where we worked on computer vision solutions for various customers. Next year I left the the startup and joined Samsung Research where I lead a whole range of AI projects with applications for medical imaging, distributed neural network training, image classification in the cloud.

 In 2015 I moved to Boston to work on Amazon Go team as a research scientist to build a worldâ€™s first cashierless store. Then I joined a startup in New York as a chief scientist. We have built visual recognition and search technoloty for apparel. The company eventually was acquired by Google in 2018 where I now lead a team of researches working on image retrieval, classification and segmentation applied to various products inside Google.
